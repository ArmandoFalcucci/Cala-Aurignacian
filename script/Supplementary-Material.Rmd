## SM Note 1: Methodological remarks on lithic analysis

All studied artifacts were first classified into broad raw material categories based on macroscopic features and, where present, the type of cortex. We recorded several metric and categorical attributes for individual lithic artifacts to investigate the technological organization of stone tool production (e.g., Tafelmaier, 2017; Zwyns, 2012). Both blanks and cores were measured using a digital caliper with a precision of 0.2 mm and a resolution of 0.1 mm. Blanks were measured after being oriented according to their technological axis, while cores were measured based on their technological orientation. For laminar cores, length was measured along the longitudinal axis of the flaking surface, as described by Lombao et al. (2023). Cortex coverage on both cores and blanks was recorded in five intervals: 0%, 1-33%, 33-66%, 66-99%, and 100%.

On blanks, we recorded the direction and orientation of removals, the shape and size of the platform, the presence and intensity of butts and lips, the profile curvature and twisting in profile view, and the external morphology of the entire blank, including its distal side in dorsal and profile views. Retouched tools and blank fragments were excluded when quantifying the morphometric features of blanks before modification. We classified laminar blanks into two main categories—blades and bladelets—based on the metric boundary established by Tixier (1963), where a bladelet is defined as a laminar blank with a width below 12 mm. While bladelets should ideally have a length at least twice their maximum width, we found that this strict definition is not always applicable to Aurignacian assemblages, especially for those produced from carinated cores. As demonstrated at Castelcivita, bladelets from carinated production can be less elongated than those from platform cores, with some having a length-to-width ratio slightly below 2 (Falcucci et al., 2024). These artifacts are abundant at La Cala (n = 104), so we introduced an additional classification borrowed by Moroni et al. (2018)—“flakelets”—to highlight these blanks for future studies. It is important to notice that flakelet in this context does not refer to the small-sized flakes resulting from the Uluzzian bipolar knapping, as in Moroni et al. (2018).

On cores, we recorded the directionality and orientation of removals, the number and shape of striking platform(s), the length and width of the flaking surface, the dimensions of the last removals (i.e., width and thickness), and the presence of removals related to initialization and maintenance operations. Core classification was based on their morphological attributes and the last visible removals, which indicate the production objective at discard. The primary core classification follows Conard et al. (2004), while blade and bladelet cores were further subclassified according to Falcucci & Peresani (2018). Carinated cores received particular attention, with their analysis and classification guided by studies focused on the Aurignacian (Chiotti, 2000; Falcucci et al., 2024; Le Brun-Ricalens & Brou, 2003; Le Brun-Ricalens, 2005). 

Tool types were classified following a revised and simplified version of common tool typologies (de Sonneville-Bordes, 1960; Demars & Laurent, 1992) as outlined in Falcucci et al. (2024). Carinated cores were also classified as tools for inter-site comparison, acknowledging their potential multifunctional purpose. Similarly, burins were classified as cores when they exhibited multiple bladelet negatives oriented along the longitudinal axis of the blank and featured a prepared, plain striking platform.

## SM Note 2: Microcomputed tomography of the split-based point from AU13

### Methodological remarks

The osseous tool from AU13 (Fig. S14a) was scanned using X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) at the Tomolab station (Mancini et al., 2007)  located at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste, Basovizza (Italy). The system utilizes a sealed microfocus X-ray source (Hamamatsu L9181) coupled with a CCD camera (VHR, Photonics Science) featuring a 4008×2672 pixel matrix with a pixel size of 12.5 µm. For both the distal and proximal regions of the tool, 1,440 projections were acquired over 360 degrees, resulting in an equivalent pixel size of 7 µm (with a focal spot size of 8 µm). The acquisition parameters for the two regions were set at 70 kVp and 100 µA for the distal region, and 115 kVp and 75 µA for the proximal region, using Al filters of 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, respectively. The slices were reconstructed using the NRecon software package (Version 1.7.0.4), with a voxel size of 7 μm. Volume renderings of the object and the internal canal network in both the distal and proximal regions were analyzed using the Avizo Software package (ThermoFisher Scientific, Version 2022.1).

The same system was used to scan the reference samples included in the analysis: two archaeological specimens from the Upper Paleolithic layers of Grotta della Cala and Grotta Paglicci, as well as a modern reference sample of unworked deer antler. The first archaeological sample is a bone point from layer GB1d (Early Gravettian - atrium series) of La Cala, identified by Boscato et al. (1997) as made from an undetermined fragment of a long bone diaphysis, with visible internal cavity and trabecular structure at one end. According to their description, the point (86 × 5 × 9 mm) features a facetted oval cross-section and an asymmetrical, beveled apex, and is covered with longitudinal striations converging toward the tip, along with short parallel transverse striations in the central area (Boscato et al., 1997). The intentional oblique fracture at the base and a shallow notch in the proximal area have been hypothetically associated with hafting practices, identifying it as a spearpoint (Boscato et al., 1997). To compare its internal microstructure with that of the split-based point from AU13, the medial area of the point was examined.

The second archaeological specimen is a fusiform spearpoint recovered from layer 17D1 (Early Epigravettian) of Grotta Paglicci (Apulia). Borgia et al. (2016) identified this sample as having been produced from a red deer (*Cervus elaphus*) antler fragment, consisting of both cortical and trabecular tissue. This tool (80 × 13 × 10 mm) has a sub-oval cross-section, a fractured apex, and is nearly symmetrical, with a rounded base featuring deep oblique notches and dark residues possibly related to hafting (Borgia et al., 2016). For comparison with the osseous tool from AU13, the central region of this spearpoint was analyzed. The modern reference of unworked antler is a tine from Cervus elaphus sourced from the osteological reference collection of the University of Siena, with the apical region of the tine considered for the present analysis.

### The bone point from layer GB1d (La Cala) and the antler point from layer 17D1 (Paglicci)

The three-dimensional network of Haversian systems in the cortical region of the bone point from layer GB1d (La Cala) and the antler point from layer 17D1 (Paglicci) are illustrated in Fig. S14d and Fig. S14e, respectively. In the bone point from layer GB1d (Fig. S14d), the Haversian canals are arranged in an orderly manner, with larger longitudinal systems located just beneath the external surface, interspersed with thinner, more randomly oriented canals towards the interior. This region corresponds to the outermost layer of cortical bone from a fragment of the diaphysis, where the presence of larger canals is associated with proximity to the trabecular structure at one of the epiphyseal ends. The longitudinal orientation of the Haversian canals is clearly visible in this specimen, which is typical of long bones in the appendicular skeleton, where the osteons are inclined at an angle between 5° and 15° from the bone axis to better resist maximum principal stress (Heřt et al., 1994).

In contrast, the cortical region of the antler point from layer 17D1 (Fig. S14e) displays a different arrangement of the Haversian systems, characterized by densely packed canals that branch both longitudinally and transversely into smaller or similarly sized canals (lateral and dichotomous branching, respectively) (Maggiano et al., 2016). This dendritic arrangement is typical of antler osseous tissue, where only about 55% of antler osteons align within 15° of the long axis of the antler beam, compared to more than 80% of secondary osteons in limb long bones aligning within 15° of their longitudinal axis (Skedros et al., 2014).

### The unworked antler reference

In the modern reference of unworked red deer antler (Fig. S14f), the canal arrangement observed in the fusiform point from layer 17D1 is apparent, although the apical region of the tine exhibits distinctive features compared to the medial portion. Here, the Haversian systems are dense and demonstrate high rates of lateral and dichotomous branching, while the contribution of transverse canals is less pronounced, as the tine tip exhibits a predominant longitudinal orientation in its microstructure.

### The split-based point from AU13

The distal end of the split-based point from AU13 displays the lowest level of preservation within the dataset (Fig. S14b). This is evidenced by a high degree of disruption in the microarchitecture of the Haversian network, resulting in a clustered arrangement of cavities that complicates the ability to trace the canal directions. In contrast, the medial region of the same tool (Fig. S14c) exhibits significantly better preservation, with a solid network visible throughout the imaged area, characterized by both longitudinal and transverse canals of varying sizes. While some interruptions are present in this region, they do not substantially affect the directionality of the majority of the larger canals, which remain clear within the overall structure.

The dendritic appearance of the Haversian network in this tool is similar to that observed in the fusiform antler point from layer 17D1 (Fig. S14e) and in the modern reference of unworked antler (Fig. S14f). This configuration is particularly evident in the central region of the split-based point from AU13 and can also be inferred for the apical region. Notably, despite its inferior state of preservation, this area still shows large transverse canals that are not present in the microarchitecture of cortical bone. Therefore, the specimen can be assigned to antler.
